# 'Inhabitent Camping Supply Co.' powered by WordPress.

#### Author: Jarid Warren [ <jaridwarren@gmail.com> ]

## Motivation

This was my first attempt at building a completely custom WordPress theme. This site takes advantage of WordPress' built-in back-end capabilities to make a completely dynamic site using PHP and the WordPress template hierarchy.

## Technology

* WordPress / PHP
* HTML / CSS
* JavaScript / jQuery
* Gulp / NPM

## Setup

**To build CSS/JS if changed:**

> gulp

(this will automatically compile Sass -> CSS and minify JS scripts)

## @TODO

* Add 'Adventures' section to front page (this code can be found on code pushed on Aug 20, 2018)
* Add 'Adventures' archive page (single page for 'Adventures' is already completed)
* Widget-ize footer
* Validate HTML on all pages (only did front-page.php)
* Make entire website mobile responsive (desktop only at the moment)
