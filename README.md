# 'Inhabitent Camping Supply Co.' e-commerce store and blog build with WordPress.

#### Author: Jarid Warren [ <jaridwarren@gmail.com> ]

## Motivation

This was my first attempt at building a completely custom WordPress theme. This site takes advantage of WordPress' built-in back-end capibilities to make a completely dynamic site using PHP and the WordPress template hierarchy.

## Technology

* WordPress / PHP
* HTML / CSS
* JavaScript / jQuery
* Gulp / NPM

## Setup

**To build CSS/JS if changed:**

`> gulp

(this will automatically compile Sass -> CSS and minify JS scripts)
